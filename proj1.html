            Road safety is of prime importance as road accidents are among the biggest causes of deaths in the country.
            Road Accidents are majorly due to violators and lawbreakers of road safety rules like not wearing helmets etc.
            Even though there are many smart systems to monitor these violations, it is complicated to keep a track of the
            data and view it efficiently anywhere. Also monitoring the permit details of other state vehicles is hard. 
            A method was proposed to address this issue, based on Deep learning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
            Here we detect the riders not wearing helmets using object detection by comparing YOLOv2 and YOLOv3.

        <p>
            This simplifies the task of traffic police who canâ€™t continuously and efficiently monitor all the violators.
            We gathered our data from three different sources. Kaggle was used to collect the data set. A number of items
            can be recognized by the real-time object recognition system YOLO in a single frame. It recognizes objects 
            more precisely and faster than other recognition systems. It can predict up to 9000 classes and even unseen
            classes. It divides the image into an m*m matrix, and each grid detects objects within itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The trained model is tested using a test dataset after training in order to measure the performance. For
            Number plate detection, we use OCR-based character recognition. The recognized license plate images of violators
            are captured and stored in a database, which is then sent to the concerned department. The stored data can be 
            easily accessed. Metrics considered for evaluation is Accuracy. YOLOv3 exhibits strong performance in terms of
            accuracy with 95.5%. Keywords: Deep learning, Object detection, Convolutional Neural Network, YOLOv2, YOLOv3.
